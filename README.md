# Azure

### Azure is divided into *Scopes*:
1. Root Management Group
2. Management Groups
3. Subscriptions
4. Resource Groups
5. Resources

<br>

### Important points:
* In Azure, what we call VPCs in AWS here they are called **Virtual Networks** (*V Nets*).
* Management Groups = a way to manage and access company polices for multiple subscriptions.
* Subscriptions = payment account/methods/scheme.
* All resources need to be inside *a Resource Group*. 
* There are also Resource Groups in AWS, but we didn't need to use them.
* With these layers (**Scopes**), we apply policies/permissions/compliance. You can set *different policies or permissions for each Scope.* 
* **Active Directory** => Microsoft's proprietary directory service; it essentially controlls users' ecosystem and enables administrators to manage permissions and control access to network resources. 
* **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: guarantees the more they fall short, the more money you can ask back.
